# todo_app

This is a very basic todo list application created using the Flask framework. Please excuse definitions, variables, etc. I intend to fix them so they are more consistent and make sense. This was my first application!

## Installation

Dependencies: 

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3

sudo apt-get install python3-pip

sudo pip3 install flask

sudo apt-get install sqlite3

sudo pip3 install passlib
```
Optional but recommended is to use a virtualenv - I like:

```bash
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```
