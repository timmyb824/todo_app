# todo_app

This is a very basic todo list application created using the Flask framework and Sqlite3. Please excuse naming for definitions, functions, variables, etc. I intend to fix them so they are more consistent and sensible. This was my first real application!

## Installation

Dependencies: 

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3

sudo apt-get install python3-pip

sudo pip3 install flask

sudo apt-get install sqlite3

sudo pip3 install passlib
```
Optional, but recommended that you use a virtualenv - I like:

```bash
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

## Notes

In addition to the todo web application there is also a seperate admin page created that shows some basic stats about users and lists. There is also the ability to delete a user and all their lists. Login for this page can be accessed at /admin.
